Native North American species are generally inconspicuous most of the year until the fall when their stems and foliage turn a distinctive coppery-red.
Uses: A. hispida, the chenille plant or red-hot cat's tail, is cultivated as a houseplant for its interesting flowers. It earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, as has A. hispaniolae, the Hispaniola cat's tail.
