Soil Requirement: A good default ratio is 1 part perlite to 2 parts standard household potting mix or peat moss. However, a better option is to go with a good quality houseplant soil.
Environment: Aglaonema prefers indirect bright light. It can adapt to low light, but the growth will slow considerably. Direct morning sunlight is fine for this plant, but avoid direct afternoon sunlight which can burn the leaves.
Watering: Aglaonemas are moderate water users, needing a deep watering (until water leaves the potâ€™s drainage holes) every 1-2 weeks. Water your Aglaonema when the top 50% of the soil is dry.
