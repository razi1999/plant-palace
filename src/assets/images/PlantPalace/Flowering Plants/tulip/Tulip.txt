Scientific Name: Tulipa
Description: Tulips are erect flowers with long, broad, parallel-veined leaves and a cup-shaped, single or double flower at the tip of the stem. Colors of the flowers can range anywhere from red to yellow to white. Some tulips are varicolored as a result of a viral disease carried and transferred to the plants by aphids.
